# FX_Prediction_ML

Having traded the FX market based off of simple momentum, and support strategies, I decided it was time I started to build a decent model to assist in my trading.
After reading many research papers, and reading through hundreds of different efforts, I decided that I would begin by adapting a stock prediction model. 
Doing so, I would hope to gain more understanding of deep learning principles, the advantages and disadvantages of a machine learning algorithm, and the pit falls that such an algorithm can fall into.

Plan is to adapt a previous stock prediction software to help predict FX price changes with deep learning using TensorFlow




Building upon a stock prediction model has led to a number of complications and the code needs further refinement.

Contemplating starting from scratch and working from a strategy first perspective and working my way through.
Also R may be more suitable/ easier than Python....


**Lots of issues, still very much a work in progress.
**Need to rework A LOT of code to adapt for a FX prediction model, and work on TensorFlow a lot more!
