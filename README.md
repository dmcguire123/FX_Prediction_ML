# FX_Prediction_ML
Adapting a previous stock prediction software to help predict FX price changes with deep learning using TensorFlow

Building upon a stock prediction model has led to a number of complications and the code needs further refinement.

Contemplating starting from scratch and working from a strategy first perspective and working my way through.
Also R may be more suitable/ easier than Python....


**Lots of issues, still very much a work in progress.
**Need to rework A LOT of code to adapt for a FX prediction model, and work on TensorFlow a lot more
